# Hotel Reservation System (Java CLI Project)

A simple command-line Hotel Reservation System built using Java as part of my internship project. The system allows users to search, book, and manage hotel room reservations categorized as Standard, Deluxe, or Suite. It features payment simulation and booking history, with all data stored using text-based file I/O.
